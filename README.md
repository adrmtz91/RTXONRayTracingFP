-----------------------Team RTX ON Project Proposal----------------------------
Team members: Steven Ryan Leonido, Jenny Quan, Adrian Martinez

Team name: RTX ON

Proposed Project: Real Time Ray Tracing on GPU with OptiX acceleration

Required libraries and framework: C++, CUDA, OptiX, RT Cores

Potential Risks or Technical Problems/Challenges: Potential challenge for this project is the learning quite a few new topics, such as item rendering and creation, ray tracing algorithm creation, OptiX library for algorithm acceleration, and real time ray tracing. Our team is currently also not familiar with graphics computing and also working on the assumption OptiX works as a library that functions well with CUDA.

Outline of Project: Research rendering, ray tracing, and object creation -> Apply ray tracing algorithms to create better rendered images -> Apply GPU and OptiX ray tracing acceleration -> Create real time ray tracing of environment with interactive camera.
